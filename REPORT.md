### Is your project complete? What parts are complete and incomplete?
It seems complete to me, as I have implemented all the widgets and filters. They are organized nicely and meeting all the requirements as outlined in the document. However, I could find one bug in the 

### What resources did you use to complete the project? Were there any resources you used outside of the course that were helpful?
Course Slides/ Lab slides/ Examples / Own activity solutions. I have refered Typescript documentation to format and refactor the code (i.e., loops, map etc.). Also used AI for solving small algorithmic details in few functions. 

### On a scale of 1 (easiest) to 10 (hardest), how difficult was this project? What did you find the most difficult?
I would say 9, could be lower if we had started earlier during the reading week. Its just every course had things coming together at the end of term.

### Was there anything in this course that you would have like to have built?
Not really, would be interesting to have some experience with CSS as well.

### Did you like the lecture (Tuesday) and lab (Thursday) format of the classs? Why or why not?
The format is perfect, I really like it.

### Is there anything your instructors could have done differently?
Everything was perfect in my opinion, got hands on experience in the lab, instructor always assisted swiftly. Response time was lower for teams so easy to communicate as well. 

### How do you imagine what you learned in this class will be helpful in the future?
Considering the UI libraries we have now, I am not sure if I would be fully utilizing this knowledge in future but since we built everything from scratch, I feel my problem solving skills have significantly improved which would be a great help in debugging UI bugs.

### Do you have any other comments that you would like to share?
Awesome course, perfect structure, didn't like the simplekit much, because it is not so simple to deal with it without detailed documentation and lack of some basic properties like placeholder for text fields.

### Is it OK if your feedback and comments in our teaching dossiers to help 
it's OK :)
